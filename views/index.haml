          Code Kata is a term coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the book The Pragmatic Programmer, in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts. A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

          Don't Break the Chain is: "spend some amount of time doing a desired activity (code kata) every day and, when you do, cross off that day on a calendar. This creates a chain of Xs showing your progress. If you don't do your specified task on one day, you don't get an X and that chain is broken."
    .hero-unit
      %p 
        KataChain automates the crossing off of the day for you (although you can do it yourself as well if it suits you). 
        %a{:href => '/edit', :class => "btn btn-primary btn-large"} Authorize KataChain for GitHub
        then
        %a{:href => 'https://github.com/KataChain/KataChain', :target => "_blank", :class => "btn btn-primary btn-large"} Fork Katachain 
      %p Now commit your kata to GitHub every day. While 365 days, or forever for that matter are great goals, they might be a bit daunting. Therefore, a 60-day challenge has been added. Try it for 60-days and I guarantee you will see improvement. Below are some individuals that have already started.
